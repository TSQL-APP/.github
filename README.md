Web-based Business App's built with T-SQL
The SQLX framework is a robust, comprehensive software development tool built around Microsoft's Transact-SQL language. Its design is a novel concept that allows developers to create comprehensive, data-driven, web-based business applications using SQL as the main language. The unique value proposition of SQLX is the ability to handle both server-side logic and client-side user interface design through the same SQL-based system.

This framework's back-end incorporates strategies for handling errors and monitoring application performance, ensuring a high level of robustness and reliability. It offers a set of pre-built stored procedures to handle common tasks and includes a powerful mechanism for building and maintaining user interfaces on the client side, powered by React.

The strength of SQLX lies in its ability to handle complex business logic and its inherent maintainability. Its flexible structure and simplified language requirement make it a powerful tool for developers to create complex applications rapidly.

SQLX has proven its worth in real-world application, having powered a major software solution for importers of fruit and vegetables. The application has successfully handled 150,000 purchases/sales and invoicing for over 350 million euros within less than two years, demonstrating SQLX's capabilities for handling high volumes of transactions and financial data.

The team behind SQLX is now considering licensing the framework to other companies and developers worldwide, paving the way for a wide variety of applications built on this powerful, SQL-centric framework.
